# Time-Dependent Flow Fields seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields

This directory contains the matlab code and test data to reproduce results presented in the work of Hadwiger et al. [1].

The code was tested with Matlab 2017b.

The script 'scriptOptimizeObserverField.m' computes an approximate observer Killing field u for a given input flow field v.

The script 'scriptResampleObservedField.m' resamples an input flow field v as it is seen through the approximate observer Killing field u, producing the observed field w_r for a given observation time r.

The output fields u and w_r are saved in raw binary format; float32 x,y,t ordered (x fastest).

# Running the Examples

To run the different experiments from the paper change the variable 'example' in scriptOptimizeObserverField and scriptResampleObservedField.
The examples 'Cylinder2D' and 'ocean' require additional datasets. [Download the data set archive](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4k5te6usafailt/data.zip?dl=0 "data"),
extract the archive and put it in the 'data' folder before running the examples.

# Acknowledgements

The ocean data set is produced by SSALTO/DUACS, distributed by AVISO, with support from CNES (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/duacs), and made available in the work of Haller et al. [2].
The Cylinder2D data set was simulated by Tino Weinkauf [3], using the Free Software 'Gerris Flow Solver' [4].
